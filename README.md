# IP Converter
Solution to convert uint32 decimals to IPv4

### Requirements
Create a function that takes an unsigned 32 bit number and returns a string representation of its IPv4 address. Java doesn't have uint32, so here we use long to represent int32. 
No 3rd party libraries should be used. Write unit tests for your code.

### Examples
* 2149583361 -> “128.32.10.1”
* 938046435 -> “55.233.115.227”
* 32 -> “0.0.0.32”
* 0 -> “0.0.0.0”
